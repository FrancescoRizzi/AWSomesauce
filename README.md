# Meta and Legalia
AWSomesauce is published online via *Github Pages*, so:

* It is a *static site* hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), an awesome hosting provider integrated with their primary project repository service.
* The site is produced using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a tool designed to facilitate creation and maintenance of static sites from a less cumbersome templated format.
   * Jekyll is licensed under [the MIT License](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/LICENSE): Copyright &copy; 2008-2017 Tom Preston-Werner and Jekyll contributors.
* The appearance of AWSomesauce is based on [Leap Day](https://github.com/mattgraham/leapday), a Github Pages/Jekyll Theme.
